In the early nineteenth century, the Chesapeake oyster beds, perhaps the world&rsquo;s richest trove of the shellfish, were discovered. Following the Civil War in 1865, the exploitation built to the fever pitch of a gold rush. More than 1,000 sail craft, including four-masted schooners, sloops, pungeys, and bugeyes, dragged heavy iron dredges ceaselessly across the &ldquo;rocks,&rdquo; as the reeflike agglomerations of the shellfish were called, catching oysters by the hundreds of bushels a day.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the height of this activity, the Chesapeake region probably was less isolated than at any time in its history, including present times. In 1886, the oyster harvest peaked in Maryland at some 15 million bushels, an annual production of edible meat equal to the yield from 160,000 head of cattle. The oyster fleet employed a fifth of everyone involved in fishing in the United States. Oyster captains ruled the waves, outgunning attempts to enforce even modest conservation by the Maryland Oyster Navy, charged with policing the oyster beds. On the positive side, the oyster industry of this era used its political clout to force the nearby city of Baltimore to construct the nation&rsquo;s most modern sewage treatment plant to protect the water quality of the bay. So intense was the oystering that it eventually altered the physical shape of the bay&rsquo;s bottom, breaking apart the reefs in which oysters naturally grew. Studies comparing old charts of the bay bottom to new bathymetric surveys have found a dramatic flattening of original bottom contours. This made oysters more susceptible to silting over, and perhaps more vulnerable to the diseases that now plague them&mdash;though this latter is still speculative.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>As harvests slid from the unsustainable peaks of the 1880s never to return, people involved in harvesting oysters sought an easy-to-build, cheaper alternative to the big sail dredge craft which would require fewer crew.

Spices come from many different plant parts: saffron and cloves are stamens and buds, black pepper and vanilla are seeds, the bark of a bush in the Laurales family supplies cinnamon, and the herbs that flavor many dishes come from dried leaves and fruit, such as the red chili pepper.

Resolution refers to the precision of detail present in an image, that is, the smallest features that can be distinguished. Astronomers are always eager to make out more detail in the images they study, whether they are following the weather on Jupiter or trying to peer into a galaxy that recently ate its neighbor for lunch.

It contains many small pockets of cell gas that range in size from inches to several feet. Each cell has a slightly different temperature from its neighbor, and each cell acts like a lens, bending (refracting) the path of the light by a small amount. This bending slightly changes the position where each light ray finally reaches the telescope.

Many societies eat vegetarian fare almost exclusively and depend solely on seed plants for their nutritional needs. A few crops (rice, wheat, and potatoes) dominate the agricultural landscape. Many crops were developed during the agricultural revolution when human societies made the transition from nomadic hunter-gatherers to horticulture and agriculture. Cereals, rich in carbohydrates, provide the staple of many human diets. Beans and nuts supply proteins. Fats are derived from crushed seeds, as is the case for peanut and rapeseed (canola) oils or fruits such as olives. Livestock, like cows and sheep, also consume large amounts of crops.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Staple crops are not the only foods derived from seed plants. Fruits and vegetables provide nutrients, vitamins, and fiber. Sugar, to sweeten dishes, is produced from sugarcane and sugar beets. Drinks are made from infusions of tea leaves, chamomile flowers, crushed coffee beans, or powdered cocoa beans. Spices come from many different plant parts: saffron and cloves are stamens and buds, black pepper and vanilla are seeds, the bark of a bush in the Laurales family supplies cinnamon, and the herbs that flavor many dishes come from dried leaves and fruit, such as the red chili pepper. Additionally, no discussion of seed plant contribution to the human diet would be complete without the mention of alcohol. Fermentation of plant-derived sugars and starches is used to produce alcoholic beverages in all societies. In some cases, the beverages are derived from the fermentation of sugars from fruit, as with wines, and in other cases, they&rsquo;re derived from the fermentation of carbohydrates from seeds, as with beers.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Seed plants have many other uses, including providing wood as a source of timber for construction and material to build furniture. Most paper is derived from the pulp of coniferous trees. Fibers of seed plants, such as cotton, flax, and hemp, are woven into cloth. Textile dyes, such as indigo, were mostly of plant origin until the advent of synthetic chemical dyes. The medicinal properties of plants have been known to human societies since ancient times. There are references to the use of plants&rsquo; curative properties in Egyptian, Babylonian, and Chinese writings from 5,000 years ago.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Biodiversity ensures a resource for new food crops and medicines. Plantlife balances ecosystems, protects watersheds, mitigates erosion, moderates climates and provides shelter for many animal species. Threats to plant diversity, however, come from many angles.<u> The explosion of the human population, especially in tropical countries where birth rates are highest and economic development is in full swing, is leading to human encroachment into forested areas. <\/u>To feed the larger population, humans need to obtain arable land, so there is a massive clearing of trees. The need for more energy to power larger cities and economic growth therein leads to the construction of dams, the consequent flooding of ecosystems, and increased emissions of pollutants.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Source: The role of seed plants (n.d.).<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the underlined sentence in paragraph 4?
